1. Maintain branching strategy consisting of 
	- Main 
	- Development  
	- Feature Branches 

2. Use pulls requests and code reviews, 
	a) Forks and Branches of the main branch are used for changes to GitHub repository.  
	b) Change commits require 
		i. Pull request to be submitted. 
		ii. Peer reviewed. 
	c) Pull requests are approved as follows, 
		i. Approved by Cody and Blake (or delegate) or,
